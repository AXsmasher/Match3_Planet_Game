# Match3_Planet_Game

Just a little example game, all tile logic/code and match 3 logic/code etc is written by me (ie the everything in the task sent to me is my own work), the procedural planet code is from Sebastian Lague, I didn't have time to create a procedural planet generator but wanted to show that I am capable of intergrating my code with others, all integration code it written by me.
